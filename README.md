# el7cvmfs
Generic HEP oriented container to be used as wrapper for CVMFS distributed software   
Built on the docker template adriansev/el7cvmfs.dock   

Given the Singularity requirements, the cvmfs fusemount can be done only from command line,   
hence the need of wrapper scripts that will use this containers, see adriansev/cvmfs2go
